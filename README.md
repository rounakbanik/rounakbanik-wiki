<h1>Rounak's Wiki</h1>

<p>Rounak's Wiki was created as the final project for CS-253: Web Development Course by Steve Huffman on the Udacity Platform.</p>
<p>The website was built on the Python webapp2 framework and hosted on the Google App Engine. The site is extremely skeletal
on the front-end due to the absence of any CSS or Javascript.</p>
